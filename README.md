# STATS 220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it looks fun
- I am interested in learning about how it applies the R language

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![family-guy-peter-dying](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3cb252d-67ec-499c-bcf0-0ff650d3041d)
