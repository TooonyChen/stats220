# Stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it looks fun
- I am interested in learning about how it applies the R language

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![commiting suicide lol]([https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif](https://tenor.com/view/suicide-family-guy-daddy-gif-13843211?quality=lossless))
